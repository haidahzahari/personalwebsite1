<h1>December 2020</h1>


<h3>As soon as I finished my spm, I continued working as a seller in bakery while waiting result SPM. 
    I work for part time to get some money before further my studies.
    Sometimes, i am become cashier and sometimes i am making and decorate cake.
     I like this job so much. This is my first experience that i learned in my life.
    Furthermore, i have experience which is helping my sister in bisness.
    For example, i did sale marketing which is using social media like Instagram and Facebook.
    At that time, i learn how to make sale and my sister taught me step by step in marketing.</h3>
