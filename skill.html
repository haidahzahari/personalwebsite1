<p>One of my skill that i have is joining running events. In elementary school and high school,
    i like to participate in running competitions during sports day. I have the ability to run fast.
    This is because i have won the running competition held at school. Many people remember that
    i am not good at the running competition. Proof, everytime there is an event involving sports,
    i will join. I really like outdoor activities that can keep my body health. I can run fast until 
    i reach the finish line. Besides that, the skills i have are making desserts such as cakes, raya
    biscuits and so on.
